# Hi, I'm Krishna

I'm a full-stack developer focused on **backend engineering** and **DevOps**.  
I like building systems that stay clean, scalable, and predictable.  
If something interests me, I learn it, build it, and ship it.

I value clarity over complexity, fast feedback over theory, and long-term consistency over shortcuts. Most of my work revolves around backend systems, frontend when needed, DevOps fundamentals, and constant self-driven learning.

### What I do
- Design and maintain backend APIs and services  
- Work with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, TypeScript  
- Use React + Tailwind for clean, minimal UIs  
- Build and deploy with Docker, CI/CD, Linux  
- Write tools and systems in Go and Rust  
- Contribute to open-source and large codebases  

### What I’m into
- Backend architecture, distributed systems, DevOps, automation, and programming languages (Go, Rust, TypeScript, C++).  
- I read a lot—tech, philosophy, self-improvement, systems thinking.  
- I care about clean UI, clean code, and clean structure.  
- Also into anime, gym, and building small things for fun.

### A bit about me
- I think best on a blank canvas—so I built **Canvas.io**.  
- I like my coffee **black**.  
- I build fast, iterate often, and keep learning new tools, languages, and ideas.
